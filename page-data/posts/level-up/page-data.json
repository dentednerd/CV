I finally published <a href=\"https://medium.com/ladbiblegroup/automating-browserstack-screenshot-generation-with-circleci-502bad7dcb7d\">an article on cross-browser test automation</a> for the LADbible Medium page that I've been working on, after weeks of refactoring and nitpicking. It's what I'll be basing my talk on at the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Web-Meetup/events/255197131/\">Manchester Web Meetup</a> that we're hosting next week, which should be a lot of fun. I think it'll be the first event we've hosted for the public since our office refurb, so it'll be exciting to see what everyone thinks of our new home. It'll also be my first talk since I spoke at the <a href=\"https://dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/2018/05/30/introducing-our-second-women-in-digital-event/\">DWP Women in Digital</a> event in June, which was hugely nervewracking but ultimately a brilliant experience.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Level Up!
