    <h2>I&apos;m a front end developer.</h2>
    <p>
      In 2017, I was awarded a scholarship at 
      <a href="http://www.northcoders.com">Northcoders</a>
      , funded by 
      <a href="http://www.ey.com/gl/en/issues/business-environment/women-fast-forward">EY&apos;s Women. Fast Forward</a> 
      initiative, to train as a JavaScript developer. I learned many new skills in an incredibly short amount of time, and I&apos;ve continued to learn and grow as a React developer in my first position since graduating. I&apos;m also really excited to be able to return to Northcoders as a tutor this summer, and share what I&apos;ve learned in the industry so far with new developers.
