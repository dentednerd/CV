    <h2>What am I looking for?</h2>
    <p>I love working with close-knit teams that encourage each other to produce high-quality projects that bring value to their users. At this stage of my career, my ideal role is one in which I can feel supported without having my hand held. I&apos;d love the opportunity to learn new tech on the job, so if your project needs me to step outside of my comfort zone, I&apos;m ready for the challenge.</p>
