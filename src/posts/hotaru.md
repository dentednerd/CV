[WIP] Gatsby, styled-components and a lot of work.

#### the journal

Traditionally, blogs organise posts in reverse chronological order. That's great if you post regularly about issues that develop over time, but if you only post once in a while about topics that aren't time-sensitive, it doesn't make a lot of sense. I was concerned that the content I wanted people to see the most was getting buried by more recent posts.

To fix this, I renamed "blog" to "journal", took the dates off the posts, and [added tags to posts](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-tags-and-categories-to-blog-posts/). Now the journal page sorts posts into categories, grouping related content together for easier searching. I also moved "journal" from fifth to second position in the sidebar menu - this is the content that will appeal to the most visitors.
