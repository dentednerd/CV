I've published an article on [BrowserStack screenshot automation in CircleCI](https://medium.com/ladbiblegroup/automating-browserstack-screenshot-generation-with-circleci-502bad7dcb7d) for the LADbible Medium page. It's what I'll be basing my talk on at the [Manchester Web Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Web-Meetup/events/255197131/) that we're hosting next week, which should be a lot of fun.

It'll be the first event we've hosted for the public since our office refurb, so it'll be exciting to see what everyone thinks of our new home. It'll also be my first talk since I spoke at the [DWP Women in Digital](https://dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/2018/05/30/introducing-our-second-women-in-digital-event/) event in June.
