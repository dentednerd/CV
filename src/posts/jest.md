Last week I created some katas to help a couple of colleagues understand the [Jest testing library](https://jestjs.io/) a little better, particularly around the concepts of mocking functions and network requests, which we do a lot in our work. In the hopes that these exercises will be useful to others, I thought I'd share them here too. Simply clone the repo, open it in your IDE of choice, and follow the instructions in the README.
